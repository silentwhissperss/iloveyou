HAPPY 2 MONTHS MY SWEET BOY🤍🤍
let’s try not to cry this time around , I just want to say these past 2 months and any day I’ve spent with you have been the highlight of my life , any moment with you feels like i finally know how to be happy . I love the feeling of being happy and I haven’t felt it before i met you. you’ve turned my life around and I can’t see myself without you, I feel like we fill in each others gaps and we are what eachother needed after such a long hard period of time in our lives , I feel so stable and at ease , god brings people into your life at the right time , and he did exactly that, you are my right time , you are my person and you will continue to be forever to come , you are the missing piece I’ve always needed in my 1000 puzzle pieces of the mess in my life , your the one thing that makes sense. And believe me when I say I will never love a soul more than I love yours. And my soul is tied to you in ways I can’t put into words , and that’s something Ive never said or experienced with anyone. god made you into such an incredible beautiful person, and i hope you realize that everything I say about you is all the truth , and im so glad I get to love that person , care for that person , and appreciate and comfort and support that person . I could be in the most beautiful places , but still somehow think about the fact that you are so much more beautiful then that , my only thought everyday, every hour , every minute, every second is you. and I’ll never ever want to change that . and no matter how far apart we are , distance will always give me a reason to love you harder , in any lifetime id run back to you , I can’t see myself loving anyone else the way i love you , I can’t see myself in the future waking up to someone else that isn’t you laying right beside me. 
I just want to thank you for loving all the parts of me that I can’t , I still don’t fully love those parts but you make me believe in it little by little every single day , I hated talking , I feel so comfortable talking to you about anything, I hated pet names , but when you say them I feel all those tingly feelings inside , I hated talking about my issues , you’ve made me feel safe enough to do that , I’ve never done the things I’ve done for you to anyone else and im going to keep it like that. you own half of my heart , when ur gone half of me is missing , your my #1 , my first priority. no one in this life , or any life will ever be better then you , top you , or ever take your place . I admire you , adore you, and will love all the parts of you that u
can’t seem to love , and i will remind you every single day that your my handsome boy , and im so beyond proud of you , I know I say it alot but no matter how much I say it , it will never reach up to the levels of how genuinely proud I am of you . I love you zen , I love your perfections , your “imperfections” as it just gives me so much more to love about you. and I never knew 1 single person out of a billion things to do in life , a billion people to talk too could effect me , change me and make me feel all these things I’ve never felt before , im so glad we’ve made it this far and it will be many more to come ,you have NO idea how much you’ve changed my life , I never knew it was this possible to love someone so much and so hard and im glad I get to give it all to you , im glad I get to spend my time with you , make jokes with you , laugh with you , cry with you , and all the silly other things and all the rest of it , I’ve never been loved correctly and these 2 months have made me realize, im in the right place , right time , with the exact right person . I just want to remind you that im always going to be here for you , no matter how hard things get , no matter how long we don’t talk , call , play , it gives us space to grow and miss eachother and love eachother stronger , and I will always be here , waiting , supporting, and loving you no matter what , im so glad my love grows for you everyday and it will continue too . Im all yours and nothing is ever going to change that , and we will always work things out together, as a team , always nd forever , may these 2 months and more be as amazing as the rest. And I want to also remind you , im dating to marry , im going to marry you one day , and if it’s not you it’s no one, and im chasing the other bitch ur marrying with a chainsaw . And you’ve been the reasons that I’ve been able to get through my days , push through all my thoughts and hard times, and I couldn’t thank you enough . I wouldn’t be here , typing this , breathing without you . kisses kisses my beautiful beautiful boy I’ll write more when I get more time but this is just a little something for you to read, I love you so so so so much my pretty boy and happy 2 months 🤍😓!!
