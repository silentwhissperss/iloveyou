Hi babyyy its been 5 months. 5 whole months. it dont even feel real, yk? we been through so much, and even now it still feels like a dream. u r the best thing that has ever happened to me. when we met on discord, i didnt think any of this would happen. i thought we would just be online friends for a bit then move on like ppl usually do. but then u stayed. u talked to me more. u made me feel like someone actually cared about me for once. and slowly, i started to care too. and then boom, i was in love. like actually, fully, crazy in love.
u saved me. and i mean that in every way possible. mentally, emotionally, spiritually. i was in the worst place back then. i didnt see a point in anything anymore. i hated myself, hated life, hated everything. but then u came in like some light i didnt know i needed. u were there when no one else was. even when i tried to push u away, u stayed. u listened. u cared. u reminded me that life had some good in it. and the crazy part is, u didnt just save me once. u did it more than once. u kept doing it every time i broke. and i know i did the same for u too. we saved each other. we held each other up when it felt like we had nothing left. and thats not something just anyone can say. thats something deep. something real.
and ml, u made me believe in god again. like actually believe. not the fake belief where ppl say they believe but dont really feel it. but the kind that makes u wanna be better. the kind that makes u cry sometimes just thinking about how much u r loved. i had lost all of that before u. i stopped praying. i stopped believing anyone was listening. but then u reminded me. u made me repent. u reminded me that god was still there. and that maybe he sent u to me when i needed him most. i dont even think u know how big that is. like u didnt just save my life, u saved my soul too. and that aint something i take lightly.
i think about u all the time. like all the freaking time. i wake up thinking about u. i go to sleep thinking about u. i miss u so much it hurts sometimes. i miss ur voice, ur laugh, the way u say my name. i miss the little things too. like the way u say goodnight. or how u always get a lil shy when u say something sweet. being in a long distance relationship is hard. it really is. but somehow, u make it feel easy. u make it worth it. i would wait forever just to be with u. i would go through all the distance and the time zones and the calls that lag and the missed texts and all of it, just to have u. just to keep u. because ur worth every second. every mile.
u changed my life. i dont say that lightly either. u really did. before u, i was just existing. now i feel like im actually living. now i smile more. i laugh more. i feel things more. i pray more. i care more. and all of that is because of u. ur love changed me. ur love made me better. and i dont ever wanna go back to who i was before u. ur the best part of me now. and im so proud to call u mine. 
happy 5 months baby. i know we still got so much more ahead of us. and i know it wont always be easy. but i promise u this. i will be here. i will stay. i will love u through all the ups and downs. through all the hard days and the good ones. i will keep choosing u. again and again and again. because ur my person. ur the one god gave me. and i aint letting u go.
sometimes i just sit and think about all the stuff we been through already. like how we started out just texting random stuff, then we got closer, and then one day it just hit me like damn, i really love this girl. and i know some ppl might not get it. they think online love aint real or whatever. but they dont know us. they dont know the late night convos, the crying, the laughing, the praying, the way we held each other up when everything was crashing down. they dont know how real this is. they dont see what i see in u. they dont hear the way my heart beats different when i hear ur voice. they dont get it. and thats okay. they dont need to. cuz i know what this is. u know what this is. and thats all that matters.
u make me feel safe. and not in a boring way, but in the way where i feel like i can tell u anything and u wont judge me. like i can fall apart in front of u and u wont run. like i can be the worst version of myself and u will still hold me. that kinda safety is rare. its real. and i thank god every day that i found it in u. or maybe that u found me. idk. maybe we just found each other when we were both too tired to keep going alone. either way, im just so glad we did.
and i love how we talk about the future. like when we say one day we gon live together, or go on late drives, or fall asleep on the same bed instead of just call. those talks make me smile like an idiot. they give me something to look forward to. like yeah life is hard asf right now… yeah we both got stuff we dealing with… but one day, it wont be like this. one day we gon wake up next to each other. no more calls. no more screens. just us, for real. and when that day comes, im gon hold u so tight u might actually pop. but fr, i cant wait for that day. i really cant.
u r not just my girlfriend. u r my best friend. u r the one i go to when im happy, when im sad, when im mad, when im scared. u r my person. and i dont want anyone else. like ever. no one gets me the way u do. no one understands the stuff i say or feel like u do. and u never try to fix me or change me. u just love me. all of me. even the broken parts. and i do the same for u. i love all of u. even the parts u try to hide. even the parts u think no one could ever love. i love them. i love you.
even in the hard moments, i still love you. cuz love aint just about the cute stuff. its about sticking around when it gets tough. its about showing up even when ur tired. its about saying im still here, even when ur mad or sad or scared. and i hope u know that i am not going anywhere. not now and not ever.
i think god really gave me u for a reason. like maybe he looked down and saw two broken kids that needed love, and said okay, here, take care of each other. and we did. we still do. and we will keep doing it. no matter what. no matter how far. no matter how long. because i believe in us. i believe in this. and i believe in u.
and can we talk a minute to talk about how beautiful u are? like actually beautiful. and not just outside, but inside too. ur heart is so big and full of love. u care so much. u feel so much. u give so much. and sometimes ppl take that for granted. but i see it. i see how good u r. and i hope u never lose that. dont let this world make u cold. dont let it change ur heart. because ur heart is one of the most beautiful things i have ever known.
i still remember the time I accidentally called u baby.. u js woke up and u missed it and I was so scared u heard it nd found me weird and I legit dmed rae immediately after crying over how down bad I was for you… I also remember how u said i love u. like actually said it. not in a jokey way. not with a haha at the end. just raw and real. i remember staring at the screen like wow. she really loves me. and my chest felt all tight and warm and i couldnt stop smiling. cuz i had loved u for a while, but hearing u say it? that was different. that hit deep. and since then, every time u say it, it still hits. i never get tired of it. u could say it a million times and i would still melt. and i hope u never get tired of hearing it from me either. cuz i really do love u. like with everything in me.
and sometimes i lay in bed just thinking about what my life would be like if we never met. and bro, it makes me wanna cry. like what if i never joined that gc? what if we never talked that one day? i cant even imagine that. cuz my life would be so empty without u in it. u changed everything. and its scary to think how close we were to never even knowing each other. but maybe it was fate. maybe god made sure we would cross paths no matter what. and im so thankful we did.
i know we r both still healing. we both got pain. we both got stuff we dont talk about much. but even with all of that, we still found a way to love. we still chose each other. even when our hearts felt too broken. even when we thought we were too messed up. we still said, yeah, i wanna love u. and that takes guts. that takes heart. and it makes our love so real to me. cuz it aint perfect. but its strong. and its honest. and its worth everything.
some nights i replay our calls in my head. like the way u giggle. or how u get sleepy and ur voice gets all soft. or when u rant about something u care about and ur voice gets faster nd louder (haha ill make it get even louder soon haha.. anyway…). i love all of that. i love all ur little quirks. like the way u say certain words. or the way u type in literal fucking gibberish, or how u use certain emojis all the time. all those tiny things. they all make me love u more. cuz theyre u. and u being u is the cutest, best thing ever.
i also think about the day we gon meet. like actually see each other face to face. and bruh i swear i might cry.. just being able to hug u, hold ur hand, look u in the eyes, all that stuff we only dream about right now. its gonna be the best day ever. and when that day comes, im not letting go. even if we just stand there and say nothing, it will be perfect. just being near u is all i want. thats it. thats all i need. 
Also round of applause for u for staying so strong and I mean that shit, ur so strong nia. even on the days when u feel weak. even when ur tired. even when u wna cry. u r still one of the strongest ppl i know. and u inspire me every day. u make me wanna keep going. u make me wanna try harder. live better. be more kind. love more deeply. thats the kinda effect u have on me. and i dont think u even realize it half the time. but i do. i see it. i feel it. and i thank u for it.
we may be just teens. but this love feels bigger than anything. it feels like forever. and maybe ppl will say we dont know what real love is. but i do. i feel it in my bones. i feel it in my soul. every time i think of u. every time i hear ur voice. every time i cry with u or laugh with u or sit in silence with u. this is real. and this is ours.
sometimes i think about how close i was to just giving up. like fully done nd everything. and if it werent for u, i prob wouldnt be here writing this. that aint just words. its the truth. u really saved me. just by being u. just by showing up. u gave me reasons to stay. u gave me light when all i had was dark. and now, i look at the world different. now, i see hope. now, i see love. now, i see god. and all of that came from u.
and i know we both been in those bad places. we both had nights where everything felt too heavy. where the pain was loud and the silence was louder. but even then, we found each other. we reached out. we held on. even if our hands were shaking. even if we didnt have the right words. we just held on. and that means everything. that shows me that this love is strong. that we are strong. that no matter what the world throws at us, we gon make it.
u r the kind of person who deserves the whole world. and i know i cant give u everything, but imma give u all i got. my time, my heart, my love, my words, my prayers. everything. u deserve flowers just for waking up. u deserve hugs every time u feel down. u deserve someone who will remind u every single day how amazing u r. and i wanna be that someone. i wanna be the one u come home to. the one u cry to. the one u laugh with. the one u build a future with. thats what i want. u. just u.
sometimes i wish i could just teleport to u. like fr. no warning. just boom im there. and i knock on ur door and u open it and we both just stand there like is this real?? and then we hug and everything makes sense. and all the waiting and hurting and missing would feel worth it. one day that dream gon be real. one day we gon be in the same room. and when that day comes, im never letting go.
i love the way u love. its so soft and full and real. u make ppl feel like they matter. like they not alone. and i know sometimes u dont see urself clearly. but i see u. i see how strong ur heart is. how deep ur care goes. and even when ur tired, u still try. u still love. and thats something beautiful. something rare. and i hope u never stop loving like that. cuz the world needs it. and i need it too.
5 months might not seem like a lot to some ppl. but to me? its everything. its 5 months of fighting for each other. 5 months of healing together. 5 months of late night convos and sleepy i love u’s. 5 months of choosing each other over and over. and thats big. that matters. and i hope we keep counting. 6 months. a year. two. five. forever. cuz i want forever with u. i want to keep waking up knowing ur mine. keep saying happy anniversary every month until we dont even gotta say it anymore cuz we already living it. just us, together.
i love the way u say my name. the way u smile nd hide it bc u think id hate it (I don’t and I wont). the way u always ask if i ate or if im okay. the way u believe in me, even when i dont believe in myself. i notice all of it. i hold it all in my heart. u might think its small but to me it means the world. every lil thing u do makes me fall harder. and i already fell all the way.
sometimes i get scared. scared of losing u. scared of messing things up. scared of the future. but then i remember how far weve come. how strong we are. how much we love each other. and then i feel okay again. cuz love like this doesnt just fade. it dont just break. we built something real. something with god in the middle. and i trust that. i trust u. and i trust us.
so yeah. happy 5 months baby. thank u for being my light. thank u for loving me when i couldnt even love myself. thank u for being patient, kind, soft, real. thank u for every prayer, every goodnight, every silly voice note, every little i love u. u r the best thing that ever happened to me. and i aint letting u go. not now. not ever. this love is forever. and u? u r my forever.s
