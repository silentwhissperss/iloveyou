hey sweetheart,
so today makes it two months. two full months since we started this journey together. its kinda wild when i think about it, like how time just keeps flying but at the same time it feels like ive known you forever. and i know two months might not sound like a long time to some people, but to me, this means everything..
youre not just a girl i talk to every day. youre the girl i want to talk to for the rest of my life. i mean that with my whole heart. even tho we got all this distance between us, like with me in dubai and you all the way in canada, somehow you still feel closer than anyone else. you always got this way of making me feel like im not alone, even when im just laying in bed staring at the ceiling or walking around lost in my own head. youre there. always.
i know we only sixteen and people might say we too young to talk about marriage or forever and all that. but they dont know what we got. they dont see the way we talk, the way we care, the way we dream together. they dont feel that spark, that real connection. its not just some teenage thing. but no. this right here is real. real love, real feelings, real future.
every time i hear your voice or see your name pop up on my phone, i feel like my whole day gets better. even the worst days got a little light in em when youre around. i dont even know how you do it, but you always know the right thing to say, even when i dont. like you read my mind or something. its kinda crazy, not gonna lie. i love that about you.
sometimes i just sit and think about the future. like what its gonna be like when we finally close this distance. when i can actually hug you, hold your hand, sit next to you and watch some dumb movie while we eat snacks. i think about walking around with you, going on late night drives, showing you dubai, and one day maybe building a home together. and i know all of that sounds far right now but i believe in us. i believe in what we have. and i know its gonna happen.
i remember the first time we talked, how easy it felt. like we just clicked. it wasnt forced or fake. it was just real. i felt safe, like i could be myself without holding anything back. and ever since then, you been the one. my girl. my heart. my person.
you got this softness about you, like you care so much. and i feel that love every day. in your messages, your voice notes, your calls. you love so loud and so gently at the same time. like you know exactly how to hold my heart without breaking it. and that means more to me than i can even explain.
i know sometimes the time zones be messin with us. like when im awake, youre sleeping, and when youre up, im tired. but we still make it work. we always find a way to talk, to check in, to show up for each other. and that right there is love. real love. putting in effort even when things aint perfect. showing up even when its hard.
there been times when i missed you so bad it actually hurt. like my chest got heavy and i couldnt think straight. but even in those moments, i never doubted us. not even once. cause this love we got? its worth it. every second. every mile. every missed call. every wait.
and i know its just two months, but baby, i already see forever with you. i see me and you growing up, building dreams, facing life together. i see us being each others best friend, biggest fan, and safe place. and i know theres gonna be ups and downs. life aint perfect. but as long as i got you, i feel like i can face anything.
you make me wanna be better. not just for me, but for us. like i wanna grow into the kind of man you deserve. the kind that protects you, supports you, listens to you, and never lets you feel alone.
i wanna be the one you run to when life gets heavy. the one who holds your hand through it all.
youre so strong, so beautiful, so kind. and sometimes i wonder how i even got lucky enough to call you mine. like what did i do to deserve someone like you? but then i remember that maybe we were meant to find each other. maybe the universe knew that even across the world, we was meant to connect. and im so glad we did.
ive seen a lot of fake love out there. people playing games, lying, pretending. but with you, theres none of that. just honesty, loyalty, and a deep love that keeps growing. and every day, i fall for you all over again. sometimes just hearing your laugh makes my whole day. sometimes just seeing your name makes me smile like a fool.
we got something rare, something people spend their whole lives looking for. and i dont ever wanna take that for granted. i wanna keep showing you how much you mean to me. not just with words, but with actions too. i wanna love you in all the little ways that matter. like remembering your favorite things, being there when you need to vent, or just sending a cute goodnight text cause i know you like that.
i know we both got dreams. you got yours, i got mine. but i hope we keep dreaming together too. like maybe one day youre gonna be doing your thing in canada, and im doing mine in dubai, but we still making it work. or maybe one day we gonna be living in the same city, building a life side by side. whatever it is, as long as youre in it, im happy.
sometimes i be thinking about random stuff, like what our wedding would look like or how we gonna decorate our first apartment. i think about the songs we would dance to, the trips we would take, the nights we would stay up talking about everything and nothing. and it all feels so real in my head. like i can almost touch it. like its just waiting for us to catch up.
i know this long distance thing aint easy. some days its harder than others. but every time it gets tough, i remind myself why we started. i remind myself of your smile, your voice, your heart. and suddenly, the distance dont seem that big anymore. cause love like this? it dont come around often. and when it does, you hold onto it tight.
you been my peace in the chaos. my calm in the storm. and i hope i been the same for you. i hope you know that no matter what happens, i got you. im here. always.
two months down, a lifetime to go. and i aint going nowhere.
sometimes when im laying in bed at night, i just be thinking about you. like not even in a deep way all the time, sometimes its just little things. like the way you say my name, or how you giggle when you get shy, or how you be texting me with all those cute words that lowkey make me blush even tho i try to act chill. you got this vibe that just lives in my head rent free. like youre always there, in the back of my mind, and honestly, i wouldnt have it any other way.
and even tho we aint in the same place, it still feels like we close. like when i wake up, youre the first one i wanna talk to. when something funny happens, youre the first one i wanna tell. when i feel off, i wanna hear your voice. you make everything feel a little lighter, a little easier. even the stuff i used to stress about dont hit the same no more cause i know i got you in my corner.
i know i be saying i miss you all the time, but like, fr… i miss you. not just in a sad way, but in a deep way. like i miss you in moments, in silence, in laughter. i miss you when im doing stuff and wish you was there with me. i miss you when i see couples out and think damn, that could be us if we wasnt a whole world apart. but even with the distance, youre still mine. and im still yours. and that right there? thats love.
we been through a lot in just two months. like getting to know each other, figuring out time zones, dealing with the late night convos, the sleepy goodnights, the random jokes, the crying, and we handled it all like a team. like two people who really wanna make it work. and i know if we can get through all this, we can get through anything.
sometimes i think about how proud i am of you. like fr, youre so strong. you handle your stuff, you deal w bs, and you still make time for me, and you love me so well. and i see all of it. even if i dont always say it, i notice. i see the effort you put in, the way you check on me, the way you make me feel wanted. and i dont take none of it for granted.
i be looking at pictures of u, or backreading our convos and i just smile. cause it reminds me that what we got is real. and it keeps me going. on days when life feels heavy or im just tired of the wait, i look at those and remember why i love you. and how much i wanna keep going till we finally close this distance.
you ever just sit there and imagine the first time we finally meet in person? cause i do. like a lot. i picture it in my head, how itll feel to see you standing there, no more screen, no more delay, just you in front of me. and i know im probably gonna be nervous as hell but also the happiest i ever been. cause that hug? that first hug? bro… thats gonna hit different. thats gonna be the moment it all becomes real.
and maybe well cry. or laugh. or just stand there holding each other, not saying nothing. but in that moment, all the waiting, all the late nights, all the distance—itll all be worth it. every second. every mile. every missed call. all of it.
sometimes i be thinking about the life we gonna build. like real talk, i see us doing the big stuff and the little stuff together. i see us grocery shopping, picking out snacks, arguing over cereal brands. i see us staying up too late watching shows, or taking naps on the couch.
i see us cooking together, burning something by accident, then laughing about it. i see us supporting each others dreams, helping each other grow, building a life that feels like home.
and when i say home, i mean you. you feel like home to me. you feel like comfort, like peace, like love. and no matter where i am, as long as youre with me, im good.
i also wanna say thank you. thank you for trusting me with your heart. thank you for being patient with me when im off. thank you for loving me when i aint even loving myself. you been so solid, so real, and i dont ever wanna lose that. i dont ever wanna lose you.
we might be young, but our love aint small. If anything, its fucking real. and i know that with every day that passes, we r just getting closer to the life we want. and yeah, some days will be harder than others. but we dont fold. we hold on. we ride through the storms together. cause thats what love is about. not just the good days, but the rough ones too. and im with you for all of it.
you make me feel safe. like i can open up, be vulnerable, say dumb stuff, dream big. you let me be me, without judgment. and thats rare. i hope i give you that same space. i hope you feel safe with me too. cause i wanna be the one you come to when you need peace. i wanna be the one who holds you up when the world gets heavy.
we been doing this for two months now, and honestly, i cant wait for all the months that follow. for the late night talks, the sleepy good mornings, the i miss you texts, the planning our future convos. i cant wait for all of it. cause every little moment with you feels like something special.
and no matter how far you are, youre always close in my heart. always. i wanna share my whole world with you. and one day, i will. one day you r gonna be right here with me, seeing it all, living it all, hand in hand.
we gonna make it, baby. i know it. cause love like this dont fade. it grows. it gets stronger. and every day with you is proof of that.
and i know that this isnt usually my style of writing.. but i was honestly having a rly off day while writing this, (its currently the 16th as im writing this and im in class), so if u find this off or not to your liking, im really sorry.
